# Surveillance-Tele-Mobile-UGV
In our project we are going to do a UGV (Unmanned ground vehicle) which contains a camera. This UGV is a IoT based device, it is controlled by web page through wi-fi. So, it is also known as tele-controlled UGV. The UGV is used for real-time monitoring and surveillance applications in household and industrial purpose and it also used in the areas that are difficult or hazardous for human access. By using ESP32-CAM's onboard camera and Wi-Fi capabilities, the system provides live video streaming, which can be accessed remotely on mobile devices or computers through web interface. low-cost surveillance robot using the ESP32-CAM Module
